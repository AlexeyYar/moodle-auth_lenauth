First of all, you need to have installed and fine working **[Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) 2.6.5+**
- upload **lenauth** folder to **/auth** folder, so files need to be inside **/auth/lenauth/**
- update Moodle DataBase. Just in admin panel click Home, and Moodle will suggest for LenAuth update
- activate the plugin. Block **Administration -> Plugins -> Authentication -> Manage authentication**
- register OAuth clients/applications at social networks and fill api data to LenAuth settings. Instructions are in the plugin admin page.

## Usage. Output in Moodle theme
Its very-very simple. You have two methods: PHP-code or static HTML-code.

- **PHP-code**. Copy PHP-code from skins table at LenAuth plugin screen opposite skin you need and paste the code into your current Moodle theme. All updates of LenAuth settings will automatically apply in theme.

**Sample PHP-code:**

`<?php if ( file_exists( $CFG->dirroot . '/auth/lenauth/out.php' ) ) : include_once $CFG->dirroot . '/auth/lenauth/out.php'; echo auth_lenauth_out::getInstance()->lenauth_output('style3-text'); endif; ?>`

- **Static HTML-code**. Click **Static HTML-code** link under PHP-code. In new window you will see static HTML-code, so you can copy it and paste in your current theme. **BUT!** this is static code, so if you will change some settings in LenAuth you need to update this HTML-code!
